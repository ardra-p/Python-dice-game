# 🎲 Dice Game in Python

Welcome to **Roll the Dice!** – a simple and fun Python game where you play against the computer. This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.

---

## 🚀 How to Play

- Press any key to roll the dice.
- Both you and the computer roll one die.
- The player with the higher number wins the round.
- The winner’s counter decreases by 1, and the loser’s counter increases by 1.
- First to reach 0 counter **wins the game**!

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Classes (`Die`, `Player`, `Dicegame`)
  - Encapsulation (`@property`, private variables)
- Random number generation (`random.randint`)
- Game loop with user interaction
- Clean code with modular structure
